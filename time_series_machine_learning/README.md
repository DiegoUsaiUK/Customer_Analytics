# Time Series Machine Learning Analysis and Demand Forecasting with H2O & TSstudio - How I used machine learning to implement a time series forecast of weekly revenue


In this project I go through the various steps needed to build a __time series machine learning pipeline__ and generate a __weekly revenue forecast__. 

I carry out a more “traditional” __exploratory time series analysis__ with _TSstudio_ and __create a number of predictors__ using the insight I gather. I then __train and validate__ an array of __machine learning models__ with the open source __library H2O__, and __compare the models’ accuracy__ using __performance metrics__ and __actual vs predicted plots__.

## The Data

In this post I’m simply loading up the compiled dataset but I’ve also written a post called [__Loading, Merging and Joining Datasets__](https://diegousai.io/2019/09/loading-merging-and-joining-datasets/) where I show how I’ve assembled the various data feeds and sorted out the likes of variable naming, new features creation and some general housekeeping tasks. You can find the full data code on this [__Github repository__](https://github.com/DiegoUsaiUK/Loading_Merging_and_Joining_Datasets).
